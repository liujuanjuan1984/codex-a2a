"""Deterministic masking of absolute filesystem paths in error-facing text.

Client-visible error messages (JSON-RPC/REST error bodies and streaming task
messages) can embed exception text that includes host-local absolute paths,
for example::

    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/ubuntu/x'

This module replaces such paths with a fixed placeholder before the text
leaves the process, while leaving URLs, relative paths, and ordinary prose
untouched. The replacement is deterministic and idempotent.
