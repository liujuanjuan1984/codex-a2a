"""Outbound A2A client network policy (SSRF guard and credential binding).

The A2A client is used by the ``a2a_call`` tool, where the target URL is
produced by the upstream model.  Without an explicit policy this creates a
server-side request forgery surface: the adapter would happily connect to
private/loopback/link-local addresses (cloud metadata, internal services) and
would attach globally configured outbound credentials to any endpoint.

This module centralizes the checks:

- only ``http``/``https`` schemes are accepted;
- userinfo credentials in the URL are rejected;
- when ``A2A_CLIENT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`` is configured, the host must match the
  allowlist (exact or ``*.example.com`` wildcard);
- unless ``A2A_CLIENT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`` is set, DNS resolution results are
  validated and private/loopback/link-local/reserved addresses are rejected
  (this also defends against DNS rebinding at connect time);
- outbound credentials may only be attached to hosts that match the allowlist.
